## Hi there!! 👩🏽‍💻
I’m a Computer Engineering & Computer Science student at USC Viterbi who likes working close to the hardware. I’m especially interested in embedded systems, robotics, and brain–computer interfaces, where software decisions directly affect physical and human-centered systems. 

## What I'm working on.. 🛠️
* Writing low-level C for AVR microcontrollers
* Learning how ADCs, timers, and interrupts behave in real embedded systems
* Building and debugging small sensing and control projects on real hardware

## What I'm into 😁❤️‍🔥
* Brain computer interfaces, noninvasive & invasive 🧠
* Robotics and assistive technology 
* Embedded systems and hardware-software integration

## Projects ⚙️
* AVR Embedded Speed Trap Sensing System
    * Built an embedded system that measures object speed using dual LED–phototransistor sensors and           hardware timers. The system computes and displays speed in real time, drives a servo-based speed         dial, and uses EEPROM-backed user-defined thresholds with RGB LED feedback for speed                     classification. 🏎️
